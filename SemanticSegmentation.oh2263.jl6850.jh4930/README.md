### DeepLabv3 Model Demo - Semantic Segmentation with PyTorch

The Jupyter Notebook provides a hands-on demonstration of using *DeepLabv3, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for **semantic segmentation*. The notebook guides you through the following steps:

- *Downloading DeepLabv3: Load the model from **Torch Hub* with different backbone architectures (e.g., ResNet-101, MobileNetV3).
- *Preparing an Image for Inference*: Process an input image to match the model's expected format.
- *Running Inference*: Use DeepLabv3 to generate segmentation masks.
- *Visualizing Results*: Overlay the predicted segmentation mask onto the original image for clear interpretation.

This demo is ideal for exploring DeepLabv3â€™s capabilities and understanding how to apply it to real-world image segmentationÂ tasks.
